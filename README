NAME
    XT::Util - utility functions for test scripts

SYNOPSIS
    In xt/02pod_coverage.t:

      use Test::More;
      use Test::Pod::Coverage;
      use XT::Util;
  
      my @modules = @{ __CONFIG__->{modules} || [] };
      pod_coverage_ok($_, "$_ is covered")
        foreach @modules;
      done_testing(scalar @modules);

    In xt/02pod_coverage.config:

      { "modules": ["Local::MyModule1", "Local::MyModule2"] }

DESCRIPTION
    These utilities are aimed at making test cases easier to reuse.

    They do not directly help you write test cases or output TAP.

  "__CONFIG__($testfile)"
    Where $testfile is a filename like "foo.t", will strip ".t" from the end
    of the file name, add ".config", slurp the contents and parse them as
    JSON, returning the result.

    If $testfile is omitted, then uses the caller's filename.

    By moving project-specific information (e.g. file names, package names,
    etc) into config files, the test file itself can be shared between
    projects.

    If no appropriate config file is found, an empty hashref is returned.
    This is by design.
